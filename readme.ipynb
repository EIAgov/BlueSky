    "# Installation instructions\n",
    "1. Clone the following repo: https://git.eia.gov/oea/nextgen-bluesky/bluesky_prototype.git. \n",
    "2. (Sauleh) Install necessary packages (link to wiki?) (I kind of forget how to do envs?)\n",

    "# How to start a run\n",
    "Run the scripts/electricity_model.py file. (add more info, will change soon with integrator)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run setup\n",
    "There are several files where features can be turned on/off and different crosswalks can be selected. All of these switches exist in the electricity/input directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature settings\n",
    "The scedes.csv file is the main switch file. The setup column names various constraint settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sw_trade: Trade switch. \n",
    "    - 1=trade on, 0= trade off\n",
    "- Sw_expansion: Capacity expansion switch\n",
    "    - 1=expansion on, 0=expansion off\n",
    "    - Note the file cem_inputs/AllowBuilds.csv also contains settings of which technologies are available to expand\n",
    "- Sw_agg_year: Switch to aggregate years based on the selected years in sw_year.csv\n",
    "    - 0 = only runs sw_year, 1= averages/aggregates all unselected years\n",
    "- Sw_rm: Reserve margin constraint switch\n",
    "    - 1=reserve margin constraints on,  0= no reserve margin constraint\n",
    "- Sw_ramp: Ramping constraint switch\n",
    "    - 0=no ramping constraint, 1= ramping constraint on\n",
    "- Sw_reserves: Operating reserve constraint switch\n",
    "    - 0 = no operating reserve constraints, 1= operating reserve constraints on\n",
    "- Sw_learning: Technology Cost learning switch. The method of which technology costs decrease as more capacity is built.\n",
    "    - 0=no learning, 1=linear learning constraint iterations, 2=nonlinear learning constraint\n",
    "    - Note this switch does nothing unless sw_expansion=1\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technology settings\n",
    "- Sw_ptbuilds.csv: contains switches for technologies and supply curve steps where capacity is allowed to build. \n",
    "    - 0=not allowed to build, 1=allowed to build.\n",
    "- Sw_ptretires.csv contains switches for technologies and supply curve steps where capacity is allowed to retire. \n",
    "    - 0=not allowed to retire, 1=allowed to retire.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spatial settings\n",
    "- Sw_reg.csv: contains switches for regions being run. These 25 regions align with NERC regions. \n",
    "    - 0=not running this region, 1=running this region.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Temporal settings\n",
    "This model has various temporal flexibility settings. The model runs a number of representative days (self-looping) with a number of periods (hour-several hours) per representative day. Any number of aggregated representative days can be used, but there must be at least 1 per season. The representative days use a weighted average of all input resource availability (is that the only thing that changes?). The representative hours also use a weighted average of all input resource availability (?).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cw_hr.csv contains the representative hour mapping. \n",
    "    - Index_hr represent each hour in a 24 hour period. \n",
    "    - Map_hr is the representative hour number each Index_hr is being mapped to. These hours must be in chronological order, Map_hr 1 can wrap around from 24 to 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Cw_s_day.csv contains the representative day mappings. \n",
    "    - Index_day is the day number of the year: 1-365. \n",
    "    - Map_s is the season mapping of these days (I probably would not change this because input files are based on the seasons). \n",
    "    - Map_day is the representative day that this Index_day is mapped to. Representative days are created using weighted averages of Index_day. Note that You cannot have a representative day span multiple seasons.\n",
    "- Sw_year.csv contains the representative years while will be run. \n",
    "    - If sw_agg_year in the scedes file is also tuned on, the representative year will be an average of all of those before it (until the previous year switched on). This also properly weights the years. Otherwise, it only runs the years that are switched on (this is intended mainly for generation-only runs).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results Viewer\n",
    "\n",
    "The results viewer is a python code that utilizes dash from plotly to create an interactive dashboard that can visualize results such as generation, capacity, and trade, from multiple runs. When running the viewer from the scripts folder, a url \"http://127.0.0.1:8050/\" can be opened in a browser to display the dashboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "After each run, a separate run folder with a timestamp should be created within the outputs folder. The viewer python code can go through each of the run folders and append the variables for the charts. The pt_colors.csv in the inputs folder controls the mapping of pt number and color in hex for each technology. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Currently testing) A batch file can use used to open the viewer which opens the url, activates the python environment, and run the python code. It uses the python environment on the machine, if the name of folder were to change, the myENV would need to be updated. \n",
