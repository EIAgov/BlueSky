# Unit tests

This directory houses unit tests for the model. Tests are split up by submodel in subfolders but often test the interfaces between models too.

Instructions to run the unit tests:

In VSCode, open the project. Click the graduated flask icon ("Testing") on the left-bottom side of the menu. Configure testing using pytest and select the unit_tests directory. Run tests by clicking the "run tests" button on the top-left. If all tests pass, each test will show a green check mark.

The purpose of unit tests are to test simple, standalone pieces of the code to ensure the code is working as intended; we expect all unit tests to pass.
